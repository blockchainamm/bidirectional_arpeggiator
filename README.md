# Bidirectional arpeggiator simulator

This python script simulates a bidirectional arpeggiator.

## Note notation

- C4 indicates the root note as C4 natural from which the arpeggiator sequence starts in ascending frequency order
- revA3 indicates the root note as A3 natural from which the arpeggiator sequence starts in descending frequency order\
   i.e., if there is rev prefixing the note name descending arpeggiator is initated
- Cs4 indicates the root note as C4 sharp from which the arpeggiator sequence starts in ascending frequency order
- revBf3 indicates the root note as B3 flat from which the arpeggiator sequence starts in descending frequency order

The notes for which arpeggiator sequence is required to be generated is entered in a list as shown below. 

The original list : ['C4', 'revA3', 'G4', 'revD4', 'A3', 'F3', 'revE4', 'Cs4', 'revAf3', 'D3', 'revBf3', 'revA4']
